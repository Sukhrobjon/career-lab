# Module 1
## The **Umpire** Method

**Understanding** - clarify what is being asked before jump into solving. Ask as many questions as you need to.
- What is the prompt in the question?
- What data type/format is the output?

**Match** - Identify similar problems you have done in the past. (You will see the pattern as you solve more interview questions).
**Plan** - Pseudocode an algorithm and prove it works(run simple input test)
**Implement** - Write the code(by translating the pseudocode you wrote)
**Review** - Test your solution by walking through it(run it with more complicated tests).
**Evaluate** - Analyze time and space complexity
